# Medical Lab Analytics using SQL

##  Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world medical laboratory database and performs
advanced SQL analysis to generate actionable business and operational insights.
It is designed to showcase SQL skills for Data Analyst / Business Analyst roles.

##  Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server
- Relational Database Design
- Advanced SQL (Joins, CTEs, Window Functions)
- GitHub

##  Database Design
The database consists of multiple interconnected tables including:
- Patients
- Doctors
- Medical Tests & Categories
- Test Orders & Results
- Payments & Insurance
- Technicians & Equipment
- Lab Branches

##  Business Questions Answered
- Which lab branches generate the highest revenue?
- What percentage of tests return abnormal results?
- Who are the top revenue-generating doctors?
- Which patients are repeat customers?
- Which technicians process the most tests?
- What is the average test turnaround time (TAT)?
- Which tests contribute the most revenue?

##  Key Insights
- Certain branches contribute disproportionately higher revenue
- Blood-related tests have the highest abnormal rates
- Repeat patients generate higher lifetime value
- Some orders have pending payments indicating billing gaps
- Technician workload varies significantly across branches

##  Advanced SQL Concepts Used
- Complex JOINs across 8+ tables
- Window functions (RANK, OVER, PARTITION BY)
- Conditional aggregation
- Subqueries
- Date & time analysis
